# Lightning Status Update: Rust and the Web

This is a very short status update and possible conversation starter about using Rust to write web services and applications.

## Are We Web Yet?

The Gist: You can build stuff!

Have something you want added to the list? Notice something out of date about it? You can contribute and submit a PR at:

## Incomplete Pieces? Database interactions

One of the more promising libraries to fix this is [Diesel](http://diesel.rs)

The main developer of Diesel sometimes live streams his work on the project.

## My (Limited) Experience

* Nickel works great for routing. I haven't used it for much else yet. [http://nickel.rs/](http://nickel.rs/)

* Hyper is incredibly simple to use as an http client for fetching third-party api data. [http://hyper.rs](http://hyper.rs)

* Quick XML was a great streaming xml parser. [https://github.com/tafia/quick-xml](https://github.com/tafia/quick-xml)

* Redis-rs was very easy to use with solid documentation. [http://mitsuhiko.github.io/redis-rs/redis/index.html](http://mitsuhiko.github.io/redis-rs/redis/index.html)

## Wrapping up: Others' Experiences?

Does anybody have any experience or information they would like to share about anything web related Rust?
