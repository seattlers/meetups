//@ ## The Operation

//@ Here is an arbitrary function we will be using to demonstrate how to use the various techniques.

use std::time::Duration;
use std::thread::sleep;

//@ It is not very complicated but it is something that we can execute with a varied duration to demonstrate concurrent operations resolving.

//@ Just imagine that this is making an http request.
