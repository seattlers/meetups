//@ # Some Setup
//@
//@ ## The Operation
//@
//@ Here is an arbitrary function we will be using to demonstrate how to use the various techniques.

use std::time::Duration;
use std::thread::sleep;

pub fn the_operation(handle: &str, duration: u64) -> &str {
    println!("Starting {}", handle);
    sleep(Duration::new(duration, 0));
    println!("Finishing {}", handle);
    return handle;
}

//@ <div class="notes">
//@
//@ It is not very complicated but it is something that we can execute with a varied duration to demonstrate concurrent operations resolving.
//@
//@ Just imagine that this is making an http request.
